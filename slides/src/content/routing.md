# Routing

---

## Why Routing?

- Routing allows the user to navigate to different parts of the application.
- It keeps your application linkable and bookmarkable and allow users to share links with others.

Routing allows you to:

- Maintain the state of the application.
- Create modular applications (every module define its own routes).
- Implement authorization (certain roles have access to certain URLs).

Note:

- Routing is optional, we can build an application that never changes the URL.

---

## Configuring Routes (1/3) - Base URL Tag

The Base URL tag must be set within the `<head>` tag of index.html:

```html
 <base href="/">
```

This tells the router how to compose navigation URLs.

Notes:

In the demos we use a script tag to set the base tag. In a real application it must be set as above.

---

## Configuring Routes (2/3) - Route Definition Object

The `Routes` type is an array of routes that defines the routing for the application.

```javascript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'component-one', component: ComponentOne },
  { path: 'component-two', component: ComponentTwo }
];
```

Each route can have different attributes. Some common attributes are:

* `path`: URL to be shown in the browser when application is on the specific route
* `component`: Component displayed when the application is on the specific route
* `redirectTo`: Redirect route if needed;
* `pathMatch`: Optional propety to match full URLs or just the beginning
* `children`: Array of route definitions objects representing the child routes

Notes:

- Each route can have either component or redirect attribute defined in the route.
- redirectTo and children properties are covered later in this chapter.

---

## Configuring Routes (3/3) - RouterModule

`RouterModule.forRoot` takes the `Routes` array as an argument and returns a _configured_ router module.
This router module must be specified in the list of imports of the app module.

```javascript
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';

const routes: Routes = [{ path: 'component-one', component: ComponentOne }];
export const routing = RouterModule.forRoot(routes);

@NgModule({
  imports: [ BrowserModule, routing ],
  declarations: [ AppComponent, ComponentOne ],
  bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]
})
export class AppModule {}

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
```

---

## Redirecting the Router to Another Route

When your application starts, it navigates to the empty route by default.
We can configure the router to redirect to a named route by default:

```javascript
export const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: 'component-one', pathMatch: 'full' },
  { path: 'component-one', component: ComponentOne },
  { path: 'component-two', component: ComponentTwo }
];
```

This tells the router to redirect to component-one when matching the empty path ('').

When starting the application, it will automatically navigate to the route for `component-one`.

---

## Defining Links Between Routes

Add links to routes using the `RouterLink` directive.

For example the following code defines a link to the route at path `component-one`.

```html
<a [routerLink]="['/component-one']">Component One</a>
```

Alternatively, you can navigate to a route by calling the `navigate` function on the router:

```javascript
this.router.navigate(['/component-one']);
```

---

## Dynamically Adding Route Components

Rather than define each route's component separately, use `RouterOutlet`.
Angular 2 dynamically adds the component corresponding to the active route into the `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` element.

```javascript
@Component({
  selector: 'rio-app',
  template: `
    <nav>
      <a [routerLink]="['/component-one']">Component One</a>
      <a [routerLink]="['/component-two']">Component Two</a>
    </nav>
    <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    <!-- Route components are added by router here -->
  `
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

## Route Parameters (1/2)

Adding `:id` in the path of the `product-details` route places the parameter in the route's path. For example `localhost:3000/product-details/5`

```javascript
export const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'product-details/:id', component: ProductDetails }
];
```

`routerLink` directive passes an array which specifies the path and the route parameter. This links the route to the parameter.

```html
<a *ngFor="let product of products"
  [routerLink]="['/product-details', product.id]">
  {{ product.name }}
</a>
```

---

## Route Parameters (2/2)

The `ActivatedRoute` service provides a `params` Observable which we can subscribe to to get the route parameters.

```javascript
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';

@Component({ ... })
export class ProductDetails {
  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.sub = this.route.params.subscribe(params => {
       // params['id'] is the product's id
    });
  }
}
```

Notes:

The reason that the `params` property on `ActivatedRoute` is an Observable is that the router may not recreate the component when navigating to the same component. In this case the parameter may change without the component being recreated.

---

## Child Routes (1/3)

Specify child routes by using the `children` route property.

```javascript
export const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'product-details/:id', component: ProductDetails,
    children: [
      { path: '', redirectTo: 'overview', pathMatch: 'full' },
      { path: 'overview', component: Overview },
      { path: 'specs', component: Specs }
    ]
  }
];
```

This will create the following API structure:

- `product-details/3/overview`
- `product-details/3/specs`

---

## Child Routes (2/3)

Using child routes requires an additional `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` just like we used in the root application component.

```javascript
@Component({
  selector: 'rio-product-details',
  template: `
    <p>Product Details: {{id}}</p>
    <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    <!-- Overview & Specs components get added here by the router -->
  `
})
```

## Child Routes (3/3)
To access a parent's route parameters:

```javascript
export default class Overview {
  constructor(private router: Router,
    private route: ActivatedRoute) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    // Get parent ActivatedRoute of this route.
    this.sub = this.router.routerState.parent(this.route)
      .params.subscribe(params => {
        // params['id'] is parent's product id
      });
  }
}
```

---

## Passing Optional Parameters (1/2)

Use the `[queryParams]` directive along with `[routerLink]` to pass query parameters. For example:

```html
<a [routerLink]="['product-list']" [queryParams]="{ page: 99 }">Go to Page 99</a>
```

Alternatively, we can navigate programmatically using the `Router` service:

```javascript
  goToPage(pageNum) {
    this.router.navigate(['/product-list'], { queryParams: { page: pageNum } });
  }
```

---

## Passing Optional Parameters (2/2)

Similar to reading route parameters, the `Router` service returns an Observable we can subscribe to to read the query parameters:

```javascript

ngOnInit() {
  this.sub = this.route
    .queryParams
    .subscribe(params => {
      // Defaults to 0 if no query param provided.
      this.page = +params['page'] || 0; // (+) converts string 'page' to a number
    });
}

nextPage() {
  this.router.navigate(['product-list'],
    { queryParams: { page: this.page + 1 } });
}
```
