## Why Angular?

- Built to scale:
  - Modules
  - Dependency Injection (that human beings can use)
  - TypeScript
  - Tooling: IDEs, [Augury](https://augury.angular.io/), ...
  - Supporting projects: Angular CLI, Universal, NativeScript, ...
- Straightforward integration with Redux for state management
- You don't need to be a JavaScript expert
- Better performance than Angular 1:
  - Improved change detection
  - Ahead of Time (AoT) compiler
