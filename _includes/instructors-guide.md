## Learner Profiles

These profiles describe the learners we are trying to help with this course,
and are meant to help us answer questions about goals, pace, and content.
Each profile has:

1.  General background
2.  What they do and don't already know
3.  What they think they want to be able to do
4.  What they will get out of the course
5.  Any special needs or consideration

<!-- .slide: id="instructor-guide-learner-profile-zuko" -->
## Learner Profiles: Zuko

1.  Taught himself PHP and JavaScript in high school;
    struggled through a CS degree (didn't see the point of the theory);
    has worked for a couple of small website companies.

2.  Wide-ranging but gappy knowledge of Unix, PHP, Python, and C;
    solid understanding of networking (DNS, AWS, etc.);
    competent with ES5 and JQuery;
    no experience with enterprise software;
    has never programmed as part of a team;
    no experience with (or interest in) the "business side of things".

3.  Wants to learn how to build big applications,
    both to advance his craft
    and to get a better job.

4.  Exposure to enterprise-scale features of framework
    (dependency injection, modularization)
    *and* the reasons they are useful.

5.  It will be hard to convince Zuko that Angular's complexity has value,
    since he could quickly throw together
    a PHP/JQuery equivalent of any of our examples.
    Zuko also prefers to learn on his own,
    and can frequently be found searching Stack Overflow and working on his own examples
    in the middle of lectures.

<!-- .slide: id="instructor-guide-learner-profile-toph" -->
## Learner Profiles: Toph

1.  Senior developer with 12 years of experience in three-tier .NET applications;
    leading a team of 4 building new desktop and mobile interfaces
    to legacy inventory control system that's being turned into a service;
    spends half her time negotiating requirements and schedules,
    the other half architecting,
    and the *other* half coding (most frequently pair debugging with her team).

2.  Solid understanding of Windows, Visual Studio, .NET,
    and enterprise-scale middleware and database technology;
    no previous experience with JavaScript.

3.  Wants to learn enough about Angular to be able to architect solutions using it
    and pair with (junior) team members who are coding and debugging.

4.  Understanding of what problems Angular solves
    what other technologies (e.g., Redux) should be used with it,
    and what development tools she should encourage her team to use.

5.  May be interrupted several times during the course
    to handle critical management issues.

## Learner Profiles: Iroh

1.  Studied computer networking at college and then got into programming;
    has been working for six years as a front-end web developer.

2.  Uses JQuery and NPM every day;
    has written a few unit tests here and there,
    but nothing systematic;
    has good self-taught design skills.

3.  Wants to get up to speed with Angular as quickly as possible;
    also wants to learn more about general programming skills
    (e.g., testing and performance tuning).

4.  Wants to go through the notes on his own,
    asking questions whenever he runs into something he can't figure out
    after fifteen minutes on Stack Overflow.

5.  Red/green Color-blind.
