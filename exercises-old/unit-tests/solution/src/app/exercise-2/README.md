## Exercise Two

The component in this folder has a property `message` and a dependency of `MessageService`.

In `exercise2.spec.ts`, use the `TestBed` utility to:

1. Test that the component initializes (has a truthy value)
1. Test that the contents of the component's `h2` match the expected phrase

Tests can be run from the `unit-tests` directory using the command `npm run test`
