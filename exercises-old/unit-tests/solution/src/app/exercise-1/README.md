## Exercise One

The component in this folder has a property `visible` and a method `toggleVisibility()`. 

In `exercise1.spec.ts`, write tests to assert the following:

1. property `visible` is true by default
2. `toggleVisibility` will switch property `visible` to `false`

Tests can be run from the `unit-tests` directory using the command `npm run test`
